Once logged in for the first time you will be asked to set a `passcode` (master password), the `passcode` will be used frequently within the application, when ever it session expired.

The passcode will be used when you want to `(generate strong password, update profile, change password, change passcode, add new item, view item, search trusted user, add trusted user, remove trusted user, remove all trusted user, delete item, and even the dashboard/landing page)`.

By default the passcode session age is set to 1 minutes, but a user can set it more-than that but less-than or equal-to 30 minutes.
